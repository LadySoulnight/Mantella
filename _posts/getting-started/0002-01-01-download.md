Mantella (currently v0.9.0) can easily be [downloaded from our GitHub project page](https://github.com/SebastianNiemann/OnlineOptimisation/archive/master.zip).

Once the archive is downloaded and extracted, you will find the following folder structure (and more):
{% highlight bash %}
mantella/
├── include/
├── src/
└── examples/
{% endhighlight %}

The `include/` folder contains all header files provided by Mantella. The `src/` folder includes the source code and is only needed to compile the library on your system. The `examples/` folder contains the source code of all examples presented below. Besides that, any other included file or folder provides support for testing, license information and development.
