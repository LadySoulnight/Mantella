[Mantella](http://mantella.info/) is an efficiency-focused C++14 header-only library for analysing and solving optimisation problems. As it only depends on the C++ standard library, Linux, Windows and Mac OS X support is a given.

**Our goal for version 1.0 is to combine a high-performance, self-accelerating optimisation experience with an easy to use API.**
